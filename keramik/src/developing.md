# Developing Keramik

When you need to add features to Keramik networks or simulations you will need to run local builds of the operator and the runner.

 * [Operator](./developing_operator.md) - long lived process that manages the network custom resource.
 * [Runner](./developing_runner.md) - short lived process that performs various tasks within the network (i.e. bootstrapping)
